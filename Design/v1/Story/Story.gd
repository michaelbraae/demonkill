# Backstory - Not shown to player
	# Your father and his assistant were trying to break 
	# the curse on the vampire race
	# for some reason (missing mcguffin?), the curse backfired on your father who became
	# infected with an active strain
	# your father's assistant tried to convince
	# your father that he could beat the virus
	# father knew that he would not survive
	#	(but he did and he's a big fucking demon)
	# so before he "died", he resurrected you from your tomb to finish 
	# his work and break the curse
	# your father's assistant felt guilty and ashamed for underestimating the curse
	# he lies to the player about his true past.
	# he claims he awoke you and brought you back to
	# bring balance to the world, of his own accord
	
	# your father's assistant; a human, member of an ancient noble house
	# that always remained loyal to their vampire overlords.

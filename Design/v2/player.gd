# player design

# The player cannot alter their appearance or weapons

# The player holds a one handed axe, this can be swung in 4 directions
#	or thrown

# When thrown, it pins enemies in place.

# When thrown, the axe can be called back to the players hand
#	damaging and sweeping all enemies in it's path

# When thrown, the players basic attack becomes a low damage punch
#	this has decent knockback and can still stun

# The axe can be recalled from anywhere
#	will appear to travel above the walls of the level
#	recalling the axe removes the player from the current possession
#	when recalled while possessing,
#		this empowers the player's basic and ranged attacks for a time 
#	a small indicator should show which direction the axe will recall from

# Unless recalled, the axe should stay in the corpse it last was in.
#	travelling between levels resets the player:
#	removing possessions and returning the axe

##### THAT'S IT FOR THE PLAYER #####

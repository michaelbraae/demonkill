# a hit scan should go from the caster to the first collision.

# a telegraph should go in a raycast from the caster to the player

# after the impact, there should be a 
#	decay effect from the caster to the collision

# due to the nature of this ability. It will probably need to be a custom AI

# perhaps instead of magical ability, I could add a pre-attack effect
# so when the character is in-pre attack, the laser should line up.
# in the attack phase, the hitscan should fire
# the caster should then go into post-attack while the decay effect continues

# a pre-attack effect should be part of the ability itself

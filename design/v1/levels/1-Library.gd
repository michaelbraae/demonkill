#	INTERIOR - DARK ANCIENT OPPULENT TOMB
#		You awaken in a stone tomb, there is a sign of a visitor
#		perhaps this person awoke you.
#
#		You rise from your tomb to find the room empty
#		and move toward the exit
#
#		Upon leaving the tomb you find yourself
#		in the main hall of the family crypt
#
#		The entrance to your tomb is to the side of a larger tomb
#		This tomb clearly belongs to the most important person
#
#		As you move toward the exit of the crypt, holes in the floor
#		force you to roll over the gaps
#
#		Some are made of a harmful dark energy
#		to show the roll's i-frames
#
#		You come accross a sword in a hole in the ground
#		as you pull the sword, an adjacent door opens
#
#		Through the door is a room with a few easy to deal with demons
#		You finish them with basic attacks
#
#		You leave down through the hall and arrive at a four way intersection
#		Two of the doors say 'Does not open from this side'
#		One door leads up to the Cellar
#
#		CELLAR
#		
#		You arrive at the top of the stairs and enter
#		a small cellar with one or two enemies
#
#		This leads to a larger cellar room with a pentagram in blood painted
#		painted on the floor in the middle of the room
#		There are a few demons scattered around
#
#		The next room has one enemy, when you hit him he will be stunned
#		and the game will pause.
#
#		The player will recieve a prompt to bite the enemy
#		When the bite button is pressed, the game unpauses
#		and the player gains health
